There are two types of NFTs that make up the AugmentedPhotoverse:

1. AugmentedPhotos (Augments, stories, scenes, chapters, volumes) 

and

2. Augies (Avatars, APAVs)

An AugmentedPhoto is a 1/1, photography/video/3D based animated or still scene, with or without music, that tells a story that takes place within the AugmentedPhotoverse, and each AugmentedPhoto features 1 or more Augies somewhere within it. For instance, an AugmentedPhoto may depict one Augie communicating with another augie or a human, and a second Augie spray painted on a building.

An Augie is a 1/1 animated or still PFP that depicts a character in the AugmentedPhoto universe. 
APAVs start as photos that I take of subjects (mostly friends and family), but then I “augment” them with animation and tweaks to turn them into a brand new character that has certain qualities.

Check out my PFP for an example. That’s Jay,  the first APAV, and he is pictured with his head connected into the worldwide neural network. Jay will appear in future AugmentedPhotos as a character. But, how often he shows up in them, will be randomized in a pool with all of the other APAVs. 

Now, let’s say u collect an APAV. That means that you “own” the character, and get a percentage of secondary sales royalties of AugmentedPhotos that feature your APAV…probably 2.5% per APAV. So APAVs essentially can pay a kind of “dividend” you might call it. 

When an AugmentedPhoto goes on sale,  any APAVs in the scene will show up as question marks “?”…. Once the sale is made the question marks will populate with APAVs at random…and the blockchain itself completes the story. 

I think this could be achieved by simply having the smart contract point at random to pre-prepared variations of each AugmentedPhoto when it executes on the initial sale. 

Let me know your thoughts when you can…and let’s have a phone convo if this is something you’re interested in pursuing further. Thanks so much for reaching out!

Also I think I wanna let every subject can keep their APAV if they want and be a player in the game for free as long as they want to….but I’ll sell variations of the original APAVs to the the public but prob still give that 2.5% royalty on their likeness on resales of the variations 

I think if the system is fair to everyone it’ll be a success
