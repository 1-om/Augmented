# Challenges

 A list of challenges faced by this NFT project

## Price

Setting the price of an NFT, which has never had a price before.
Of course we want maximum fair value for the NFT but lower prices can be inclusive & thus helpful in community building.

## Fairness

Augments need to fairly feature Augies. Sophisticated users should not be able to snipe rare augies or get featured in augments.

## Security

Mint information should not be extractable from testnet etc.

## Experience

We would like to avoid gas auction wars, maybe?
