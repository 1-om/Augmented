There are two types of NFTs that make up the AugmentedPhotoverse:
 
Augies (Avatars, APAVs)
 
and
 
AugmentedPhotos (Augments, episodes, stories, scenes, chapters, volumes) 
 
 
An Augie is a unique animated (or possibly still) PFP that depicts a character within the AugmentedPhotoverse.  Every Augie has their own, unique backstory within the APverse. For instance, there’s Dolly Coinz, an adored rockstar, Rex a bot broking criminal, Chuck the Shaman a sought after healer and medicine man, Chris P a famous rapper etc... There will be a total of 100 Augies in the original cast, which will be made available, at random, all at once on public mint. Every Augie is a unique piece of art, but some Augies may/will be alternate versions of the same character… Jay vs Crying Jay, Dolly Coinz vs Evil Dolly, etc…
Augies will be 1x1 aspect .gif files under 11 MB so as to be shareable on Twitter and elsewhere, either 720 x 720 or 1080 x 1080 (maybe would be cool if some could be 720 and some 1080? Maybe not?)
Most Augies start as photos that I take of subjects (mostly friends and family), and then I “augment” them with animation and tweaks to turn them into a brand new animated character that has certain qualities.
Maybe an Augie is the same base photo as another character in the collection, but a Pepe version. Another Augie, maybe it’s based on a licensed photo/3D model or an AI rendition of a public figure like Elon Musk, or Michael Saylor. Or, maybe it’s one of a select group of Augies known as the “Bot Army,” a rare group of 10 Augies that are at least in part based on AI imagery for the animated PFP, plus these special Augies will be each be equipped with an AI Twitter bot that broadcasts their adventures in the APverse on a Twitter feed that nobody has access to except the token itself. This Twitter bot will tweet out AI generated text and AI generated still images that are like mini episodes/scenes which star that particular AI Augie…the AI generated image scene will feature this Augie’s likeness and backstory. Mostly, the AI generated text and visual content will depict the individual members of the bot army trying to phish, scam, rob, and otherwise harm the other 90 Augies. These Twitter bots would be calibrated to answer each other’s tweets, as well as troll other select famous accounts in the web3 ecosystem and otherwise….
 
QUESTION: What will the bot driven Twitter feeds that broadcast the AI adventures of each Augie in the bot army show in their twitter PFPs? Will it be same as the NFT that the owner may want to display in their personal PFP? I don’t think I like that…
 
ANSWER??: Say each member of the bot army are cyborg pieces of art..a combo of AI generated art via text prompt, as well as photography and human tweaks…the main NFT PFP image is a full animation with partial AI imagery and partial a model photo…BUT maybe in the bot controlled Twitter account for the PFP it would be just the AI generated parts of the augie image for the bot PFP, void of any trace of the human part which only lives in  the fully animated main PFP…I expect that people will want the full image for their own personal profile pic on Twitter, so this will allow them to do that, and the AI part will have a life of its own…
 
Augie public mint and royalties: All 100 Augies will be available for public mint. 
 
When someone mints an Augie, the Augie they actually receive will be assigned at random, by the blockchain. The public mint proceeds will be paid to AugmentedPhoto (Om and Jason) and they will pay a 2.5% royalty to the ETH wallet address of the model that the image is based on. 
 
QUESTION: Should the price of the public mint go up as we run out of inventory? Maybe. 
 
Each time an Augie is resold on the secondary market, a 10% royalty is paid by the buyer, of which 2.5% will be paid to the ETH wallet address of the model the Augie is based on, and 7.5% will be paid to AugmentedPhoto (Om and Jason).
 
Augie Royalty enforcement???…If someone buys an Augie on the secondary market and does not pay the 10% royalty, maybe that Augie should be be made ineligible to appear in future AugmentedPhoto scenes??  But, If the misbehaving Augie subsequently pays the 10% royalty, then we will make the Augie eligible to appear in AugmentedPhotos once again??
 
**Note** At least one Augie (Chuck the Shaman) will pay a portion or all generated royalties to a charity that supports mental health. 
 
 
In addition to being cool PFPs,  all 100 Augies will be eligible to randomly appear in AugmentedPhotos, but only once they are minted…. 
 
 
But, what are AugmentedPhotos, exactly?
AugmentedPhotos are essentially episodes, or chapters in the AugmentedPhotoverse saga. 
 
Eventually, once we build a team, I see AugmentedPhotos graduating to AugmentedLife… becoming immersive environments that you can experience as your Augie, from that Augie’s perspective, as opposed to just having a .gif file as your PFP. Becoming your Augie should be especially interesting for Bot Army holders, I reckon…
But for now, GIF, MP4 and JPG. The artwork for AugmentedPhotos are each unique 1/1, photography/video/3D based animated or still scene, with or without audio/music, which tells a story that takes place within the AugmentedPhotoverse. Like the AI infused Augie avatars, I intend to work command prompt AI into the AugmentedPhoto scenes, as well, somehow. 
Each AugmentedPhoto chapter features the likeness of 1 to 5 Augie avatars somewhere within it. For instance, an AugmentedPhoto may depict one Augie communicating with another Augie, or a human, or both, and a second Augie may be spray painted on a building, while another flashes on an advertisement on a billboard,  or news report on a TV screen.
When and exactly where each of the eligible Augies will appear as characters within AugmentedPhoto scenes will be unknown until the scene is sold at auction, and subsequently chosen at random by the blockchain.
AugmentedPhoto episodes will drop 1 at a time for auction, at any time, starting any time after the first Augie is minted. I think it will be cool if we have scheduled mint dates,I especially could see that being ideal if it was a drop with guest artists or music producers, but realistically most will be surprise or close to surprise drops that are on a “when I get something done” basis.  
Each AugmentedPhoto chapter will feature 1 to 5 “mystery positions” that will eventually populate with Augies, but only once the blockchain selects the lucky Augies at random, which happens immediately after the auction has been won. 
 
Augies that are eligible to be randomly selected for AugmentedPhoto scenes fit this criteria:
 
-the augie has been minted by the time the auction ends 
-the augie is in “good standing” - meaning all royalties have been paid at time auction ends (this is a big MAYBE and we need to discuss)
 
 
Each mystery spot in an AugmentedPhoto will have a number assigned to it, between 1 and 5, depending on the total number of mystery spots in the scene. 
 
Once the auction ends, the blockchain will randomly select which Augie is assigned to which spot, for that particular AugmentedPhoto. For example, an AugmentedPhoto goes up with 2 spots for augies, spot 1 and spot 2….there are 10 eligible augies, and the blockchain selects Rex and Dolly to be in the scene… the output would say something like “Spot 1: Rex, Spot 2: Dolly,” and then Jason will have the info he needs to finish the artwork, and the accompanying text that will be based on the background stories of the chosen augies, especially the ones that end up in prominent positions in the scene. 
 
Immediately after the Augie selection, the contract will pay the wallets that contain the actual token of the chosen augies to be in the scene receive a 2.5% royalty on resale, and the remainder of the 10% total royalty will be paid to AugmentedPhoto…for instance if there are 2 augies in a scene, 2.5% would be paid to each augie, and 5% would be paid to AugmentedPhoto…if there are 5 augies in the scene, 2.5% will be paid to each augie, and 0% will be paid to AugmentedPhoto 
 
Prior to this augment story being sold at auction to the highest bidder (1 eth reserve…once met 7 day auction)  the augment story nft will display a 3D question mark flashing in the space where the 1 lucky augie will eventually appear after the auction is won
 
Once the augment has been sold at auction to the highest bidder, the contract will pick 1 lucky augie from the pool of augies that have been won at auction, no matter who owns them at the time…at this time the metadata of the augment story will be updated manually so the image now shows the scene but with the word (AUGMENTING) Flashing Where the augie will soon be 
 
 
…At this time I’ll be busy augmenting/rendering the augment story piece with the correct augie…may take a while do to rendering…maybe even 24 hours or more…but it doesn’t matter…. the winning augie will be verifiable in etherscan immediately after the augment story is sold at auction (hopefully/probably causing the value of said augie to instantly go up! lol)
 
Once I get done rendering, I will upload the file and change the metadata to reflect the final piece with the winning augie and it will stay that way forever….
 
 
Another thing we need to discuss is augie holder IP rights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now, let’s say u collect an APAV. That means that you “own” the character, and get a percentage of secondary sales royalties of AugmentedPhotos that feature your APAV…probably 2.5% per APAV. So APAVs essentially can pay a kind of “dividend” you might call it. 
 
When an AugmentedPhoto goes on sale,  any APAVs in the scene will show up as question marks “?”…. Once the sale is made the question marks will populate with APAVs at random…and the blockchain itself completes the story. 
 
I think this could be achieved by simply having the smart contract point at random to pre-prepared variations of each AugmentedPhoto when it executes on the initial sale. 
 
Let me know your thoughts when you can…and let’s have a phone convo if this is something you’re interested in pursuing further. Thanks so much for reaching out!
 
Also I think I wanna let every subject can keep their APAV if they want and be a player in the game for free as long as they want to….but I’ll sell variations of the original APAVs to the the public but prob still give that 2.5% royalty on their likeness on resales of the variations 
 
I think if the system is fair to everyone it’ll be a success 
 
*NOTE: all augies, and augment stories pay a total of 10% royalty on resale…for an augie, it’s always 2.5% to the model, 7.5% to AugmentedPhoto…for an augment/story on the other hand, all the augies included in the scene receive a 2.5% royalty on resale, and the remainder of the 10% total royalty will be paid to AugmentedPhoto…for instance if there are 2 augies in a scene, 2.5% would be paid to each augie, and 5% would be paid to AugmentedPhoto…if there are 5 augies in the scene, 2.5% will be paid to each augie, and 0% will be paid to AugmentedPhoto 
 
Prior to this augment story being sold at auction to the highest bidder (1 eth reserve…once met 7 day auction)  the augment story nft will display a 3D question mark flashing in the space where the 1 lucky augie will eventually appear after the auction is won

NOTE****Season 1 of the stories should only be open to augies, then in season 2 maybe add the ability to wrap your pfp nft that u own the IP for to add it into the expanded AugmentedPhotoverse
 
 
Also I’m wondering if all 100 augiez should be distinct and separate characters…if I have the same characters with diff emotions then there’s a chance of more than one version of that character to end up in the AugmentedPhoto which I don’t wAnt..,,unless Om can add a condition that all augies in a story must be a diff character and not just one with a diff emotion
